 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a idiot.

     Being a idiot includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

     1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.  
     1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a idiot.  
     1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER idiot.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a idiot would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY idiot. Fix the problem yourself. A non-idiot would submit the fix back.
